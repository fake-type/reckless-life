Burning. Burning. Everything is burning and falling apart.  
The smell of burning flesh. The terrible screams. The pain that fills your guts every time you breathe.

Each time I look back on them, each time I remember them, my cheeks twist into an awful smile.

Because these flames are what created me.  
They are my grave, and my cradle.

...Now cry in hell.  
Howl at the joy of birth, at the hatred of birth, and at the despair of birth!
